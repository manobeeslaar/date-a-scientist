2018-11-15 - Capstone Project for Codecademy Machine Learning Fundamentals

Using dataset given from OKCupid.

Questions asked:
1.  Can you predict the religion preference by orientation?
2.  Can you predict diet by the religion a person follows?

Using various Machine Learning techniques to try and answer these questions - techniques used:

1.  K-Nearest Neighbors
2.  K-Neighbors Regressor
3.  Linear Regression

The above was used to answer the question and find out how accurately the outcome can be predicted.

Note that the type of questions are endless and multiple datasets can be generated from the original.

Personal note:
I have to say that I really enjoyed the course and would do it again in a heartbeat, maybe next time I can better understand some terms and try to use more techniques available as we have only touched the service with this course.
Also, this was one of the most difficult courses to grasp the finer detail.


The presentation should consist of:


- at least two graphs containing exploration of the dataset
- a statement of your question (or questions!) and how you arrived there 
- the explanation of at least two new columns you created and how you did it
- the comparison between two classification approaches, including a qualitative discussion of simplicity, time to run the model, and accuracy, precision, and/or recall
- the comparison between two regression approaches, including a qualitative discussion of simplicity, time to run the model, and accuracy, precision, and/or recall
- an overall conclusion, with a preliminary answer to your initial question(s), next steps, and what other data you would like to have in order to better answer your question(s)
